# Association Pattern Discovery Rule Test (Machine Learning)

This project focus on Data Mining and Machine Learning.
It consists of a DM algorithm developed inside a web servlet that, taken as input a large dataset of integer (propabilities), calculate the correlation between the data columns, test the Association Pattern Discovery Rule up to second order, and return the pairs of data that pass the test.
