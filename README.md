# Association Pattern Discovery Rule Test (Second Order)

This project focus on data mining data mining.
It is a DM algorithm developed inside a web servlet that, taken as input a large dataset of integer, calculate the correlation between the columns data, test the Association Pattern Discovery Rule (second Order ), and return the test result for any row in group of two.
