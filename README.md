# Association Pattern Discovery Rule Test (Second Order)

This is part of the project built for the Research Project in data mining I took part.
It is a web servlet that, taken as input a large dataset of integer, calculate the correlation between the columns data, test the Association Pattern Discovery Rule (second Order only), and return if the test is passed or failed for any row in group of two.
